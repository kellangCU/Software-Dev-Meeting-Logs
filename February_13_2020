Our group met at the Engineering Library in the Math Building from 9:30am to 11:30am.
Members in attendance:

Keenan Warble was not in attendance as we have not met him at the last three lab sections.

Our group worked on the project milestone number 2, with discussion about what features, functional requirements,
and non-functional requirements we need in our proposal document. Most of our work was finished, and we will
need to finish up the requirements over the weekend before Monday.
