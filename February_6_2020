Keenan Warble was not in attendance as we did not meet him at the last lab section.

Our group (irrational grunting) confirmed the campus event web application as our main software development idea.
We filled out most of the requirements on Milestone 1, with the exception of the Version Control and Application
Architecture sections, due to:
1. We could not find Jack Kawell's (TA) Git usernmae
2. We would like to discuss stack architecture with the TA before confirming a plan. 

We are planning on meeting Jack Kawell during his office hours tomorrow at 10am to confirm these steps.
We will finishing the Milestone 1 over the weekend and submitting by Monday.
